Theme: Running out of Power

Definition of Power:
- the ability to do something or act in a particular way, especially as a faculty or quality.
- the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behavior of others or the course of events.

Ideas:
- You're energy is lowering while fighting off the bad guys, protect the castle as long as you can

- The electricity in a city is running out, get to the substation before it runs out completely
-- Angry pedestrians are hungry for electricity so they have turned crazy

- You are an electrical current, and you have just left the source, and have to travel to the destination in 1 minute before the power runs out
-- Currents traveling the opposite way can collide with you and that's bad
-- Power level
